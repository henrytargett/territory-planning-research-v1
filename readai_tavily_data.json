They're this quarter's infrastructure problem. And most companies are building them completely wrong. Here's what changed in November 2025: We've moved from \"crafting the perfect prompt\" to context engineering, systematically feeding AI models structured information so they perform reliably at scale. The Model Context Protocol (MCP) isn't just another API standard. It's the shift from treating AI like a search engine to treating it like a deployed system that needs real infrastructure. I'm watching teams realize: Your AI strategy is now your infrastructure strategy. GPU orchestration isn't optional anymore. Kubernetes clusters that once handled stateless web apps are now juggling multi-GPU workloads that can't fit on a single accelerator. Platform teams are tuning for latency and throughput 24/7. The companies spending $3 billion on AI compute deals? They're not overpaying. They're securing capacity before everyone else figures this out. Meanwhile, most enterprises are still treating AI like a feature to \"add on.\" But AI agents need: a.Continuous monitoring (they're non-deterministic) b.Context pipelines (not prompt libraries) c.Cost optimization (GPU time is billed idle or not) d.Infrastructure that doesn't exist in your current stack The gap between \"we use AI\" and \"we built for AI\" is widening fast. Three things the winners are doing differently: 1. Building for agents, not humans: Digital ecosystems designed for autonomous systems, not just UX 2. Treating context as infrastructure: Structured data pipelines feeding models, not ad-hoc prompt. 3. Orchestrating compute like it's 2025: Dynamic GPU allocation, not hoping AWS has availability This isn't about having better AI. It's about having the architecture to run it at scale without burning cash on idle GPUs or shipping unreliable outputs. The Binary Big Bang is here. Apps are becoming agent platforms. Prompts are becoming pipelines. And infrastructure is the new competitive moat. If you're still optimizing prompts instead of engineering context, you're already behind.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) 🧠 The shift from simple analytics to Generative AI and the integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) is transforming almost every industry. This evolution places immense pressure on traditional system architectures. System Design Implications for AI/ML: • Need for Specialized Infrastructure (Hardware/Resource Management): AI/ML requires systems designed to accommodate GPU-heavy computation for model training and inference. Unlike typical stateless web services, ML workloads are often stateful and resource-intensive. The design must incorporate mechanisms for smart load balancing across these specialized resources and guarantee elastic scalability—meaning the system can quickly provision and de-provision expensive GPUs based on demand (often orchestrated via Kubernetes clusters optimized for accelerated computing). • Data Pipeline Complexity (MLOps): The quality of an AI model depends entirely on the data it consumes. System design now focuses heavily on establishing intricate data ingestion, transformation, and storage (ETL/ELT) pipelines. This entire lifecycle, known as MLOps, must be automated, monitored, and version-controlled. Key design requirements here include guaranteeing data lineage (tracking data origin) and ensuring data freshness for continuous model retraining.

 ⚡️ Ray Serve: Distributed Inference for the AI Era Inference is where intelligence meets scale — and Ray Serve is the runtime that makes large-scale AI deployment effortless, modular, and production-ready. Here are 6 core insights driving how Ray Serve redefines AI inference architecture: 1️⃣ Unified model serving layer — deploy multiple LLMs, embeddings, and APIs under a single scalable endpoint. 2️⃣ Autoscaling in real time — Ray Serve dynamically adjusts replicas based on live traffic and system load. 3️⃣ Multi-model pipelines — chain multiple models (retrievers, rerankers, generators) within one composable graph. 4️⃣ Low-latency inference — request batching and async execution maximize GPU and CPU utilization. 5️⃣ Stateful actors for context — maintain memory and session data across inference calls, critical for RAG and agentic use cases. 6️⃣ Seamless integration — deploy directly on Kubernetes, AWS, GCP, or on-prem, all through the same API surface. Ray Serve bridges experimentation and production — enabling AI systems that scale with intelligence, not just compute.

 Databricks Just Redefined Enterprise AI — But Only a Handful of Companies Are Ready Everyone is excited about Databricks’ latest announcements — Agent Bricks, ML flow 3.0, serverless GPUs, vector search, and a unified path from data → models → agents → action. But here’s the uncomfortable truth: AI agents don’t magically make a company intelligent. They amplify whatever the company already is. - If your data is clean → agents scale your impact. - If your data is chaos → agents scale the chaos. - If governance is weak → agents expose you. This shift is exciting — and a little terrifying — because the real question isn’t: “Can we build an AI agent?” It’s “Are we ready for the consequences of deploying one?” 👇 I’ve written a full article breaking down: • What Databricks actually changed • The hidden readiness signals of AI-mature companies • Why most organizations are not prepared • What enterprises should do right now 👉 Read the full article here: [https://lnkd.in/eCAggGnF](https://www.linkedin.com/redir/redirect?url=https%3A%2F%2Flnkd%2Ein%2FeCAggGnF&urlhash=azVu&trk=public_post-text) [#Databricks](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Ffeed%2Fhashtag%2Fdatabricks&trk=public_post-text) [#EnterpriseAI](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Ffeed%2Fhashtag%2Fenterpriseai&trk=public_post-text) [#AIAgents](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Ffeed%2Fhashtag%2Faiagents&trk=public_post-text) [#DataEngineering](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Ffeed%2Fhashtag%2Fdataengineering&trk=public_post-text) [#MachineLearning](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Ffeed%2Fhashtag%2Fmachinelearning&trk=public_post-text) [#Lakehouse](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Ffeed%2Fhashtag%2Flakehouse&trk=public_post-text) [#GenerativeAI](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Ffeed%2Fhashtag%2Fgenerativeai&trk=public_post-text) [#DataStrategy](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Ffeed%2Fhashtag%2Fdatastrategy&trk=public_post-text) COE – [https://lnkd.in/gbSWWxKa](https://www.linkedin.com/redir/redirect?url=https%3A%2F%2Flnkd%2Ein%2FgbSWWxKa&urlhash=4hSv&trk=public_post-text) COE LinkedIn - [https://lnkd.in/gCfiMH\\_K](https://www.linkedin.com/redir/redirect?url=https%3A%2F%2Flnkd%2Ein%2FgCfiMH_K&urlhash=j4SI&trk=public_post-text)\n\n  [\"Databricks Just Redefined Enterprise AI — But Only a Handful of Companies Are Ready\"   trikonanagaraj1.wixsite.com](https://www.linkedin.com/redir/redirect?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftrikonanagaraj1%2Ewixsite%2Ecom%2Fdata-engineer%2Fpost%2Fdatabricks-just-redefined-enterprise-ai-but-only-a-handful-of-companies-are-ready&urlhash=Gnaf&trk=public_post_feed-article-content)\n\n  [23](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Fposts%2Ftrikonanagaraj_databricks-just-redefined-enterprise-ai-activity-7394592953618575360-WpnS&trk=public_post_social-actions-reactions)\n\n  [Like](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Fposts%2Ftrikonanagaraj_databricks-just-redefined-enterprise-ai-activity-7394592953618575360-WpnS&trk=public_post_like-cta)   [Comment](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Fposts%2Ftrikonanagaraj_databricks-just-redefined-enterprise-ai-activity-7394592953618575360-WpnS&trk=public_post_comment-cta)\n\n  To view or add a comment, [sign in](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Fposts%2Ftrikonanagaraj_databricks-just-redefined-enterprise-ai-activity-7394592953618575360-WpnS&trk=public_post_feed-cta-banner-cta)\n* [Peter Chaianov](https://nl.linkedin.com/in/peter-hostkey?trk=public_post_feed-actor-name)\n\n  Chief Technology Officer / Co-founder @ Hostkey.com | Networking, Cloud Computing\n\n  + [Report this post](/uas/login?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Fposts%2Fpeter-hostkey_ai-deepseek-machinelearning-activity-7388562844683825153-W4-y&trk=public_post_ellipsis-menu-semaphore-sign-in-redirect&guestReportContentType=POST&_f=guest-reporting)\n\n  HOSTKEY Launches DeepSeek-R1:70B - Enterprise-Ready Reasoning AI We've deployedDeepSeek-R1:70B on our ML platform - a breakthrough reasoning model distilled from the full DeepSeek-R1, based on Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct.

Learn how to optimize your models and scale them without breaking the bank. The path to production-ready AI services often faces resource constraints: GPU costs, memory, and inference latency. Unoptimized models quickly exhaust budgets and infrastructure. The solution isn't just more hardware; it's about smart architectural and engineering choices. 1️⃣ Model Optimization ➡️ Quantization & Pruning: Reduce model precision (e.g., FP32 to INT8) or remove redundant connections. This shrinks model size and speeds up inference significantly, often with minimal accuracy impact. Ideal for edge deployments or high-throughput environments. ➡️ Knowledge Distillation: Train a smaller \"student\" model to mimic a larger \"teacher\" model, achieving similar performance with fewer resources. 2️⃣ Infrastructure & Deployment ➡️ Kubernetes for Elastic Scalability: Orchestrate AI workloads with dynamic resource scaling. HPA and custom metrics ensure you pay only for peak usage, scaling down during lulls. ➡️ Serverless Inference: Cost-effective for sporadic or event-driven AI tasks. Abstracting infrastructure, serverless functions bill only for execution time, fitting unpredictable inference patterns. 3️⃣ Data Pipeline Efficiency ➡️ Optimized Data Loading: Critical for training and inference. Use formats like Parquet, pre-process data for faster access, and leverage distributed file systems to reduce I/O bottlenecks. ➡️ Batching & Caching: Group inference requests to maximize GPU utilization. Cache frequently accessed data or model outputs to reduce redundant computations. 4️⃣ Monitoring & Profiling ➡️ Granular Metrics: Robust monitoring of GPU usage, memory, network I/O, and inference latency is vital. Tools like Prometheus and Grafana, with profiling, pinpoint bottlenecks. Without visibility, optimization is guesswork. Scaling AI means building resilient, cost-effective systems developers can confidently manage. It blends ML expertise and robust systems engineering. By integrating these strategies, teams achieve sustainable growth and deliver impactful AI solutions without prohibitive costs.

The stack that emerged has seven distinct layers. Most companies are missing three of them. The shift from prototype to production changed everything. What started as simple API calls became sophisticated multilayered architectures. Hyperscalers like Amazon, Microsoft, and Google now offer end-to-end solutions. Here's what the modern AI stack looks like: 🔧 Accelerated compute (GPUs, ASICs) 📚 Model catalog (first-party, partner, open-weight) ⚡ Model invocation and context management 🔄 Orchestration workflows for complex processes 👨💻 Developer tools (APIs, SDKs, CLI) 💬 User interfaces (chatbots, agents, apps) 🛡️ Cross-cutting concerns (security, monitoring) The missing pieces? Most organizations skip the middle layers. They jump from models to user interfaces. They forget about proper orchestration, context management, and governance. This creates brittle systems that can't scale. Production-grade AI needs all seven layers working together. Each serves a specific purpose. Remove one and the whole system becomes unreliable. The companies getting this right are building modular architectures. They're investing in proper data pipelines, vector databases, and monitoring tools. They understand that moving from pilot to production isn't just about bigger servers. It's about building enterprise-grade systems from the ground up. What layer is your organization struggling with most?

Most of these solutions leverage powerful inference engines like vLLM or TensorRT under the hood. 🔧 Here are my takeaways: \\* Directly using vLLM is often simpler for single node and it gives more performance with low latency, batching and so on \\* KServe stands out when it comes to managing deployments and scaling AI workloads - it significantly simplifies the deployment process of model deployments.

The result? - Wasted tokens, - Slower response times, - And growing infrastructure costs. But there’s a smarter way. Add an AI-assisted preprocessing layer, a lightweight model (like GPT-5-nano) that quickly extracts meaning, filters noise, and summarizes before the heavy model runs. This small step can cut input tokens by 80% while keeping the same accuracy. I’ve built this pattern on AWS Lambda + S3 + EventBridge, where each document is processed serverlessly and in parallel - no servers, no idle cost. In one of my recent projects, this approach turned a costly bottleneck into a 8-10× cheaper, fully automated pipeline, a real game changer in production. It scales automatically and you pay only for what you use. ✅ Simple ⚡ Fast 💰 Cost-efficient Here’s the core idea: Document → Pre-Filter (lightweight model) → Main Model → Result It’s not always about bigger models - sometimes, the biggest improvement comes from smarter architecture. How much could your AI pipeline save if it started thinking smarter before thinking harder?

Scaling AI models from proof-of-concept to production-grade services presents unique challenges. High computational demands, latency requirements, and managing operational costs can quickly become bottlenecks for even the most promising AI applications. This isn't just about throwing more hardware at the problem; it's about smart architecture. ➡️ Resource Optimization: This is foundational. It involves techniques like model quantization, pruning, and efficient batching to minimize compute and memory footprint without significant performance degradation. Utilizing specialized hardware (GPUs, TPUs) effectively, and implementing dynamic batching based on real-time load, ensures you're getting the most out of your infrastructure. For distributed inference, frameworks like Ray or Kubernetes-native solutions can orchestrate resource allocation seamlessly. ➡️ Strategic Caching: Often overlooked, caching can dramatically reduce inference load and improve response times. ✅ Request Caching: For frequently identical or similar inference requests, serve pre-computed results. ✅ Feature Caching: Store pre-processed features for common input patterns, avoiding redundant computation. ✅ Model Caching: Keep frequently used model versions or weights in fast-access memory. This reduces redundant computations, offloading the core model from repeated, identical work. Tools like Redis or in-memory caches are invaluable here. ➡️ Modular Design: Breaking down monolithic AI pipelines into smaller, independently deployable services transforms scalability and maintainability. 💡 Microservices for Inference: Decompose complex models into sub-models or feature extraction services. Each can be scaled, updated, and managed independently. 💡 API-Driven Interfaces: Clear contracts between modules allow for independent evolution. 💡 Fault Isolation: A failure in one component doesn't bring down the entire system. This approach leverages principles from distributed systems, enabling easier A/B testing, faster iterations, and more robust deployments. Think Kubeflow Pipelines or custom orchestration built on Kubernetes. Implementing these strategies requires a deep understanding of your model's behavior and your infrastructure's capabilities. It's an iterative process of profiling, re-architecting, and monitoring, ultimately leading to more resilient, cost-effective, and higher-performing AI systems. For developers and engineers, mastering these techniques is key to unlocking true AI potential at scale.

Today’s enterprises need architectures that can seamlessly handle both — predictive models that forecast and generative systems that create. --- 💡 The Challenge Traditional MLOps setups were built for structured data and batch inference. But LLMs bring new complexities — GPU orchestration, vector databases, retrieval pipelines, context windows, and prompt versioning. The result? A pressing need for hybrid AI infrastructure that unifies these two worlds. ⚙️ The Solution: Scalable AI Pipelines A modern AI stack blends performance with flexibility through: 1. Containerized Deployments: Kubernetes, Docker, and Ray to scale across compute clusters. 2. Unified Feature & Embedding Stores: Combining Feast and ChromaDB for ML and LLM data workflows. 3.Hybrid Serving Architecture: Tools like KServe, Triton, and vLLM to deploy models across cloud, edge, and GPU nodes. 4. Observability & Governance Layers: Monitoring drift, hallucinations, and bias while ensuring compliance with GDPR and the EU AI Act. 5. Continuous Training & Fine-Tuning Pipelines: Automating retraining for ML and fine-tuning for LLMs under a single CI/CD framework. --- 🧩 The Outcome Scalable pipelines don’t just deploy models — they operationalize intelligence. They turn experimentation into impact, enabling data teams to deploy, monitor, and iterate faster across every AI modality. At Uplatz MLOps & LLMOps Studio, we’re building this next-generation infrastructure — one that unifies data, models, and governance into a seamless operational fabric. ──────────── 📩 Contact Us Want to design next-generation MLOps & LLMOps architectures with us?

It’s the formula turning open-source models into production-ready powerhouses. Why this matters: Many teams assume they need GPT-4 or Claude for serious apps. But with the right Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) setup, LLaMA models can deliver enterprise-level performance. Here’s what makes it work: 1. Lightweight + Smart • LLaMA isn’t the biggest model. • But combined with RAG, it feels much “smarter.” • Retrieval fills the gaps fine-tuning can’t. 2. Cost advantage • Open-source models slash API costs. • Pairing with RAG means fewer tokens, cleaner context. • More control, less spend. 3. Flexibility wins • You can host LLaMA locally, in the cloud, or hybrid. • RAG pipelines let you control chunking, indexing, retrieval strategies. • The system bends to your data, not the other way around. 4. Evaluation matters • Don’t just trust the “open-source hype.” • Test retrieval relevance, latency, and hallucinations. • Small optimizations (like better chunking) → big performance boosts. Key takeaway: LLaMA alone is good. RAG alone is powerful. But RAG + LLaMA together? That’s where open-source meets real-world impact. 💡 My question for you: If you had to choose today— Would you build your next app on a closed-source giant like GPT-4, or on an open-source + RAG stack like LLaMA?

 The Model Context Protocol is a standardized way for AI applications to interact with external tools and data sources. Think of MCP as a universal adapter that lets AI models connect to various services in a consistent way. Why MCP Matters? Before MCP, every tool integration was custom-built. If you wanted your AI to check weather, send emails, or query a database, you’d write unique code for each integration. MCP solves this by providing: - Standardized Interface: Tools expose themselves through a common protocol - Discoverability: Agents can learn what tools are available and how to use them - Modularity: Add or remove tools without changing agent code - Separation of Concerns: Tool servers handle specific tasks while agents orchestrate Know more about building AI Agents with MCP:

 🚀 The Modern AI/ML Roadmap (2025) If you’re looking to break into or level up in AI/ML, here’s the practical path forward: 🔹 Python & Software Basics – Clean code, Git, APIs. 🔹 Math Foundations – Stats, probability, linear algebra. 🔹 Data Prep & EDA – Because clean data = smarter models. 🔹 Core ML – Classification, regression, clustering, evaluation. 🔹 Deep Learning – The foundation, not the finish line. 🔹 NLP & Transformers – BERT, GPT, attention mechanisms. 🔹 LLMs & Prompting – Working effectively with large models. 🔹 RAG – Combining LLMs with your own data. 🔹 AI Agents – Multi-agent systems, task planning, workflows. 🔹 MLOps – Docker, Kubernetes, CI/CD, monitoring. 🔹 Vector Databases – Pinecone, Chroma, Weaviate. 🔹 Observability & Governance – Fairness, compliance, LangFuse. 🔹 Cloud & API Integrations – AWS, Azure, GCP. 🔹 Real Projects – End-to-end apps that deliver real business value. 💡 The key? Don’t just learn the tools—focus on building things that solve real problems.\n\n\n\n  [4](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Fposts%2Fkuldeepmishra07_the-modern-aiml-roadmap-2025-if-you-activity-7376533581419950080-oKZN&trk=public_post_social-actions-reactions)\n\n  [Like](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Fposts%2Fkuldeepmishra07_the-modern-aiml-roadmap-2025-if-you-activity-7376533581419950080-oKZN&trk=public_post_like-cta)   [Comment](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Fposts%2Fkuldeepmishra07_the-modern-aiml-roadmap-2025-if-you-activity-7376533581419950080-oKZN&trk=public_post_comment-cta)\n\n  To view or add a comment, [sign in](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Fposts%2Fkuldeepmishra07_the-modern-aiml-roadmap-2025-if-you-activity-7376533581419950080-oKZN&trk=public_post_feed-cta-banner-cta)\n* [typedef](https://www.linkedin.com/company/typedefai?trk=public_post_feed-actor-name)\n\n  450 followers\n\n  + [Report this post](/uas/login?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Fposts%2Ftypedefai_typedef-project-fenic-a-dataframe-for-activity-7377020444463476736-0dih&trk=public_post_ellipsis-menu-semaphore-sign-in-redirect&guestReportContentType=POST&_f=guest-reporting)\n\n  Fenic brings the reliability of DataFrame pipelines to AI workloads—semantic joins, markdown parsing, transcripts, and more—now strengthened with the 0.3.0 update.

A fully managed service that gives you API access to top-tier foundation models (FMs) like Claude (Anthropic), Titan (Amazon), Jurassic (AI21), and Stability AI—without provisioning infrastructure or managing GPUs. 🔹 Why Bedrock Stands Out -Unified API for multiple models -Serverless scalability -Enterprise-grade security (IAM, audit logging) -Seamless integration with AWS stack (Lambda, S3, SageMaker) -Support for fine-tuning, RAG, and tool use 🔹 Claude + Bedrock = Conversational Intelligence Claude models (Haiku, Sonnet, Opus) shine in multi-turn dialogue, structured output, and safe reasoning. With Bedrock, you can: ✅ Build chat apps with real-time Claude responses ✅ Use Claude in RAG pipelines for semantic search ✅ Stream responses, cache prompts, and handle tool calls ✅ Return structured JSON/XML for downstream automation ✅ Extend Claude with multi-tool orchestration and contextual memory 🔹 Behind the Scenes of a Chat App When a user types “Define quantum computing”: Your frontend sends the message to your backend Backend invokes Claude via Bedrock API Claude processes the prompt and returns a response Bedrock delivers the result, and your UI displays it All of this—without managing infrastructure or worrying about model deployment. 💡 Whether you're developing AI-powered solutions for education, enterprise automation, customer engagement, or research—AWS Bedrock + Claude provides a flexible, scalable foundation to build with confidence.

Complex Lifecycle Management: Distributed training jobs require coordinated startup/shutdown. Model deployments need graceful draining and version transitions. These patterns exceed Deployments and StatefulSets capabilities. Case Study: ScaleML's Multi-Tenant AI Platform Background: ScaleML operated a Kubernetes-based AIaaS platform serving hundreds of data science teams. They hosted everything from real-time inference APIs to large-scale distributed training jobs. The Problem: Their platform was plagued by three issues: 1. GPU Fragmentation: The cluster had mixed GPU types, causing scheduling failures despite available resources. 2. Training Job Starvation: Long-running training jobs would [...] it on a specialized ML platform, such as Hugging Face, Paperspace, or other similar platforms. These platforms handle the provisioning of specialized hardware (GPUs) and often include optimized LLM serving frameworks. 💡 Still simple and fast deployment with minimum configuration, but with dedicated GPU performance for specialized inference. Option 3: Enterprise grade models If you need to manage the full machine learning lifecycle (MLOps), including model monitoring, A/B testing, and high-volume scaling, the choice is to look at Vertex AI (Google) or SageMaker (AWS). Also consider Bedrock (AWS) or Azure OpenAI Service, which are 'Foundation Model as a Service' options.

However, the inherent characteristics of AI workloads-extreme burstiness, heterogeneous resource requirements (CPUs, GPUs, specialized accelerators), and diverse lifecycles (from milliseconds-long inference to days-long training)-push vanilla Kubernetes to its limits. The default scheduler, designed for relatively predictable web services, struggles with the dynamic nature of AI. Advanced Kubernetes orchestration for AIaaS requires custom schedulers, specialized operators, and intelligent autoscaling that understand the unique semantics of AI workloads, transforming Kubernetes from a generic platform into an AI-native operating system. The Special Demands of AI on K8s AI workloads on Kubernetes present three fundamental challenges that standard components cannot adequately address: 1. Resource Heterogeneity: Not all GPUs are equal. Workloads may require specific GPU types (A100 vs H100), memory configurations, or even multiple GPUs with fast interconnoutes (NVLink). The default scheduler treats GPUs as a generic resource. 2. Burstiness and Queue-Awareness: Inference traffic can spike by orders of magnitude in seconds. Training jobs may be submitted in batches. Standard autoscaling reacts too slowly and lacks awareness of queued requests. 3. Complex Lifecycle Management: Distributed training jobs require coordinated startup/shutdown. Model deployments need graceful draining and version transitions. These patterns exceed Deployments and StatefulSets capabilities. Case Study: ScaleML's Multi-Tenant AI Platform Background: ScaleML operated a Kubernetes-based AIaaS platform serving hundreds of data science teams. They hosted everything from real-time inference APIs to large-scale distributed training jobs. The Problem: Their platform was plagued by three issues: 1. GPU Fragmentation: The cluster had mixed GPU types, causing scheduling failures despite available resources. 2. Training Job Starvation: Long-running training jobs would monopolize high-end GPUs, while inference services suffered from resource scarcity during peaks. 3. Slow Scaling: The Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) would take 3-5 minutes to respond to inference spikes, causing request queuing and timeouts. The Solution - AI-Native Kubernetes Stack: ScaleML implemented a comprehensive AI-aware orchestration layer: Article will continue in comments\n\n  [5 Comments](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Fposts%2Fharis-berkovac_aiaas-on-kubernetes-custom-schedulers-operators-activity-7381346916237803522-D-Zy&trk=public_post_social-actions-comments)\n\n  [Like](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Fposts%2Fharis-berkovac_aiaas-on-kubernetes-custom-schedulers-operators-activity-7381346916237803522-D-Zy&trk=public_post_like-cta)   [Comment](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Fposts%2Fharis-berkovac_aiaas-on-kubernetes-custom-schedulers-operators-activity-7381346916237803522-D-Zy&trk=public_post_comment-cta)\n\n  To view or add a comment, [sign in](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Fposts%2Fharis-berkovac_aiaas-on-kubernetes-custom-schedulers-operators-activity-7381346916237803522-D-Zy&trk=public_post_feed-cta-banner-cta)\n* [Arpit Nigam](https://in.linkedin.com/in/arpit-nigam-689651113?trk=public_post_feed-actor-name)\n\n  + [Report this post](/uas/login?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Fposts%2Farpit-nigam-689651113_aws-inferentia-trainium-activity-7385879557142339585-gLd-&trk=public_post_ellipsis-menu-semaphore-sign-in-redirect&guestReportContentType=POST&_f=guest-reporting)\n\n  Lately, I’ve been exploring how to make large-scale inference truly scalable without burning through GPU costs. That’s where AWS’s Inferentia and Trainium chips come into play. While GPUs have been the default for both training and inference, they’re not always cost-efficient once models move to production. AWS built these two accelerators with very specific goals: • Trainium → for training large models efficiently. • Inferentia → for running inference at scale with low latency and cost. Both run on the same Neuron SDK, so the workflow remains unified — you train on Trainium, compile with Neuron, and deploy on Inferentia. It’s a smooth transition from experimentation to production. The results are quite impressive — • Up to ~70% reduction in inference cost compared to GPUs. • Seamless scaling using EKS or SageMaker. • Native support for PyTorch, TensorFlow, and Hugging Face models. As AI workloads continue to grow, optimizing for inference isn’t just about performance anymore — it’s about architecture, efficiency, and sustainability. I’m currently testing Inferentia with EKS autoscaling and Neuron SDK performance tuning to see how it performs under real workloads. If you’ve tried similar setups, I’d love to exchange notes and learn from your experience.

 Tinker is a managed training service by [Thinking Machines Lab](https://www.linkedin.com/company/thinkingmachinesai?trk=public_post-text) that lets researchers fine-tune large language models via simple API [calls.You](https://www.linkedin.com/redir/redirect?url=http%3A%2F%2Fcalls%2EYou&urlhash=Zf22&trk=public_post-text) write a Python loop on your CPU (defining data, environment, and loss), then use Tinker’s functions to distribute the exact same computations on GPUs in the cloud.Unlike black-box services, Tinker exposes low-level primitives (e.g. forward\\_backward, optim\\_step, sample) so you retain full control over the training algorithm.Under the hood, Tinker handles multi-node scheduling, GPU resource allocation, and fault tolerance, enabling you to run small or large training jobs without managing infrastructure.Crucially, Tinker uses LoRA fine-tuning (low-rank adapters) instead of full-weight updates, which allows many training runs to share the same GPU memory pool and greatly reduces cost.\n\n  [Tinker API Overview

You’ve built your custom model—now, how do you go live? The choice depends on your model's size and resource needs: Option 1: Small, CPU friendly models If your model is small, highly optimized, and friendly to a CPU, deploy it as a separate Docker service. For example, on platforms like Railway or a serverless container environment like Cloud Run/AWS Fargate. 💡 Simple, fast deployment. Your main API communicates with the model over internal networking. Great for an MVP or a presentation. This is ideal for high-throughput, low-latency applications where cost efficiency is key. Option 2: Larger, GPU required models If your model is large (like Llama, Mistral, etc.) and demands dedicated GPUs, deploy it on a specialized ML platform, such as Hugging Face, Paperspace, or other similar platforms. These platforms handle the provisioning of specialized hardware (GPUs) and often include optimized LLM serving frameworks. 💡 Still simple and fast deployment with minimum configuration, but with dedicated GPU performance for specialized inference. Option 3: Enterprise grade models If you need to manage the full machine learning lifecycle (MLOps), including model monitoring, A/B testing, and high-volume scaling, the choice is to look at Vertex AI (Google) or SageMaker (AWS). Also consider Bedrock (AWS) or Azure OpenAI Service, which are 'Foundation Model as a Service' options. These simplify deployment by offering API access to pre-trained models, and could even be moved closer to Option 2 in terms of operational complexity. 💡 Great for governance, customization, and a fully managed end-to-end MLOps process. There are plenty of other options on the market. Define your performance goals (latency and throughput) first to choose the right place for your app's brain. 🧠 [#LLM](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Ffeed%2Fhashtag%2Fllm&trk=public_post-text) [#AI](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Ffeed%2Fhashtag%2Fai&trk=public_post-text) [#Deployment](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Ffeed%2Fhashtag%2Fdeployment&trk=public_post-text) [#Railway](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Ffeed%2Fhashtag%2Frailway&trk=public_post-text) [#HuggingFace](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Ffeed%2Fhashtag%2Fhuggingface&trk=public_post-text) [#Python](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Ffeed%2Fhashtag%2Fpython&trk=public_post-text) [#MLOps](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Ffeed%2Fhashtag%2Fmlops&trk=public_post-text)\n\n\n\n  [2](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Fposts%2Foleksii-tumanov_llm-ai-deployment-activity-7382369392879370240-VxJS&trk=public_post_social-actions-reactions)\n\n  [Like](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Fposts%2Foleksii-tumanov_llm-ai-deployment-activity-7382369392879370240-VxJS&trk=public_post_like-cta)   [Comment](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Fposts%2Foleksii-tumanov_llm-ai-deployment-activity-7382369392879370240-VxJS&trk=public_post_comment-cta)\n\n  To view or add a comment, [sign in](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Fposts%2Foleksii-tumanov_llm-ai-deployment-activity-7382369392879370240-VxJS&trk=public_post_feed-cta-banner-cta)\n* [Dileep Sathyan](https://ca.linkedin.com/in/dileep-sathyan?trk=public_post_feed-actor-name)\n\n  + [Report this post](/uas/login?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Fposts%2Fdileep-sathyan_azureml-machinelearning-cloudcompute-activity-7381799303901769728-pTu2&trk=public_post_ellipsis-menu-semaphore-sign-in-redirect&guestReportContentType=POST&_f=guest-reporting)\n\n  Successfully moving a Machine Learning model from research to production hinges on selecting the optimal Azure Machine Learning Compute Target at every stage. Inefficient resource allocation is a major drain on MLOps budgets. Here is a clear strategy for professional compute selection: 1. Azure ML Compute Instance: Dedicated, stateful environment for tasks like notebook development, data exploration, and debugging. Treat the Compute Instance as a personal development machine; it provides consistency but must be stopped manually or via a schedule when not in use to control costs. 2. Azure ML Compute Cluster or Serverless Compute: Highly scalable, on-demand compute for scheduled, large-scale, and repetitive jobs. These clusters are designed to auto-scale to zero after a job completes. Always favor these for production workflows to ensure you only pay for the compute time used. The Golden Rule: Choose targets that stay running (Compute Instances) only for interactive, continuous work. For all scheduled or batch workloads, select scalable, on-demand clusters that automatically terminate. Budget efficiency starts here.

I recently found myself in the same boat while being part of an exciting new project. Although I had a basic understanding of Large Language Models, the concept of Inference as a Service was completely new to me. Everyone’s been throwing around AI buzzwords and LLMs like wildfire, but what does it all mean?\n\n### What’s the Big Deal with LLMs?\n\nIn the world of AI, LLMs, or Large Language Models have gained a lot of attention for their ability to understand and generate human-like text. These models, such as GPT-3 developed by OpenAI, are trained on vast amounts of text data and can be used for various natural language processing tasks such as language translation, text summarization, and question answering. Inference as a Service refers to the ability to access and use these pre-trained models through an API, allowing developers to integrate the power of LLMs into their own applications without having to train and maintain the models themselves.\n\n### The Buzz About Inferences\n\nBut what about this \"Inference as a Service\" thing? In simple terms, inference is the process where these models generate responses or predictions based on the input they get. Imagine you ask an LLM to write a short story about a cat who becomes a superhero. The process of coming up with that story is called inference. ( speaking of cats, try out [https://http.cat/](https://www.linkedin.com/redir/redirect?url=https%3A%2F%2Fhttp%2Ecat%2F&urlhash=Lr0D&trk=article-ssr-frontend-pulse_little-text-block) 😺 )\n\nUsing IaaS, developers can leverage the capabilities of LLMs to enhance the natural language processing capabilities of their own applications, leading to more human-like and contextually relevant interactions with users. This streamlined access to powerful language models has the potential to revolutionize the way we interact with AI systems, making them more versatile and adaptable to a wide range of tasks.\n\n### The Relationship Between LLM and Inference\n\nSo, how exactly are LLMs and inferences related? Think of an LLM as a super-intelligent brain. This brain has been trained on a vast amount of data and can understand and generate human-like text. Inference is the process where this brain gets to work. It takes your input (a question, a prompt, a command) and processes it to generate a meaningful response.\n\nHere's a simple analogy: if the LLM is a well-read author, inference is the act of writing a new piece based on what the author has learned. Every time you ask an LLM to do something (generate text, answer a question, translate language), you're triggering an inference.\n\n### Why Should We Care?\n\nHere’s where it gets exciting. Inference as a Service means providing this smart, predictive power as a service over the internet. Just like you use cloud services for storage or computing, you can now tap into AI models to generate text, answer questions, or even translate languages, all on demand.\n\n### Cool Real-Life Applications\n\n1. Fake News Detection: Imagine an app that can instantly analyze news articles or social media posts and determine their authenticity. An LLM can cross-reference facts, check for biases, and even highlight suspicious sources, helping users discern fake news from real news.\n2. Personalized Learning: In education, LLMs can be used to create personalized learning experiences. An AI tutor can generate custom exercises, provide instant feedback, and even adapt lessons based on a student’s progress. This makes learning more engaging and effective.\n\n### Evolution of LLMs: From Early Models to LLaMA2 and LLaMA3\n\nThe journey of Large Language Models (LLMs) has been marked by rapid advancements and significant milestones. Before diving into LLaMA2 and LLaMA3, let's take a brief look at the evolution of LLMs and how we got here.\n\n### Early LLMs\n\nThe first generation of LLMs, like GPT-2, were groundbreaking in their ability to generate coherent text based on large-scale data training. These models demonstrated the potential of using deep learning to understand and generate human language, but they had limitations in terms of accuracy, efficiency, and handling of complex queries.\n\n### Advancements with GPT-3\n\nGPT-3 represented a significant leap forward. With 175 billion parameters, it was able to understand and generate more nuanced and contextually relevant text. However, it still faced challenges like biases in responses and the need for fine-tuning for specific tasks. This laid the groundwork for further improvements and more specialized models.\n\n### Now, let’s talk about some specific models: LLaMA2 and LLaMA3. These are advanced versions of LLMs developed to be even more efficient and powerful.\n\n* LLaMA2: Known for its improved accuracy and efficiency, LLaMA2 can handle more complex queries and provide more relevant responses. It's like upgrading your AI assistant to a version that’s faster and smarter. This model benefits from enhanced training techniques and a larger dataset, making it more reliable for a wider range of applications.\n* LLaMA3: The latest in the series, LLaMA3 brings even more capabilities to the table, including better contextual understanding and reduced biases. It’s designed to be more aligned with human values and can adapt to a wider range of applications. This model incorporates advanced algorithms to minimize biases and improve the quality of interactions, ensuring responses are more aligned with user expectations.\n\nThese models show just how rapidly AI technology is evolving, making it even more accessible and useful for everyday tasks. With each iteration, LLMs become more capable of understanding and generating human-like text, providing more accurate and contextually appropriate responses.\n\n### Steps to Get an LLM Working\n\nIf you're curious about how to set up an LLM for your own projects, here are the steps to get it up and running:\n\n### 1. Model Selection and Preparation\n\n* Research and Selection: Begin by researching available LLMs to find the one that best suits your needs. Consider factors like model size, pre-training data, and performance benchmarks.\n* Preprocessing: Prepare your data for training or fine-tuning. This involves cleaning, tokenizing, and structuring the data in a format that the model can understand.\n\n### 2. Environment Setup\n\n* Infrastructure: Set up your computational environment. This includes provisioning cloud instances or setting up on-premise servers with sufficient CPU, GPU, and memory resources.\n* Dependencies: Install necessary software dependencies. This includes deep learning frameworks (like TensorFlow or PyTorch), model libraries, and any other required tools.\n\n### 3. Model Deployment\n\n* Loading the Model: Load the pre-trained model into your environment. This might involve downloading the model weights and configuration files.\n* Inference Pipeline: Develop an inference pipeline that prepares incoming data, runs it through the model, and processes the output.\n\n### 4. Creating an API\n\n* API Development: Create an API using frameworks like FastAPI to expose your model's inference capabilities. This allows users to send requests and receive responses over HTTP.\n* Endpoint Design: Design endpoints that accept input data, trigger the inference process, and return results.\n\n### 5. Deployment and Monitoring\n\n* Deployment: Deploy your API on a cloud platform like AWS, GCP, or Azure. Use orchestration platforms like Kubernetes to manage your deployment.\n* Monitoring and Logging: Implement monitoring and logging to track the performance of your inference service.\n\n### Getting Inference Working: focusing on dynamic provisioning, Let's make it technical!\n\n### Dynamic Provisioning with KServe and Envoy\n\nDynamic provisioning ensures that the system automatically adjusts resources based on demand. Two essential tools for this are KServe and Envoy.\n\n[KServe](https://www.linkedin.com/redir/redirect?url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub%2Ecom%2Fkserve%2Fkserve&urlhash=c7WJ&trk=article-ssr-frontend-pulse_little-text-block) is an open-source project that simplifies the deployment of machine learning models on Kubernetes. KServe is a standard, cloud agnostic Model Inference Platform for serving predictive and generative AI models on Kubernetes, built for highly scalable use cases, it Supports modern serverless inference workloads with request-based autoscaling including scale-to-zero on CPU and GPU.\n\n[Envoy](https://www.linkedin.com/redir/redirect?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww%2Eenvoyproxy%2Eio%2F&urlhash=cecN&trk=article-ssr-frontend-pulse_little-text-block) is a high-performance, open-source edge, and service proxy designed for cloud-native applications. It provides robust load balancing, service discovery, and observability features.\n\nHere’s how we can leverage KServe and Envoy for dynamic provisioning in the inference world:\n\nAuto-Scaling with KServe:\n\n* Setup: KServe allows you to deploy and manage ML models as Kubernetes services. You can define a deployment configuration that includes auto-scaling policies.\n* Auto-Scaling: KServe supports horizontal pod autoscaling, which automatically adjusts the number of pod replicas based on CPU and memory usage or custom metrics like request latency.\n* Inference Workloads: By setting up auto-scaling, you ensure that your inference service can handle varying loads efficiently, scaling up during peak times and scaling down when demand is low.\n\nLoad Balancing with Envoy\n\n* Setup: Envoy can be deployed as a sidecar proxy in your Kubernetes pods or as a standalone gateway. It handles incoming requests and distributes them across multiple instances of your inference service.\n* Service Discovery: Envoy integrates with Kubernetes service discovery mechanisms to automatically detect and route traffic to healthy instances.\n* Advanced Features: Envoy offers advanced load balancing algorithms, retries, timeouts, and circuit breaking to ensure the high availability and reliability of your inference service.\n\nCombining KServe and Envoy\n\n* Integration: By integrating KServe with Envoy, you can create a robust, scalable, and efficient inference service. KServe handles the deployment and scaling of ML models, while Envoy manages the traffic routing and load balancing.\n* Benefits: This combination ensures that your inference service can dynamically adjust to varying loads, provide fast and reliable responses, and maintain high availability.\n\n### Networking and Security\n\nWhile my focus is on dynamic provisioning and scaling, networking and security are also critical components:\n\n* Networking: Ensure smooth communication between components by setting up VPCs, subnets, and routing tables. Implementing service discovery with Kubernetes DNS or Consul allows services to find and communicate with each other seamlessly.\n* Security: Protect your inference service by encrypting data in transit and at rest, implementing robust user authentication and authorization, and using firewalls and VPNs to secure your network.\n\n### Wrapping Up\n\nIn just a short period, I went from “What’s an inference?” to exploring the potential of setting up a service that could transform how businesses use AI. The next time you hear someone casually dropping AI and LLM into a conversation, you’ll know there’s some serious tech behind those words.\n\nI will be sharing some more in-depth technical details soon about how to implement it, so stay tuned for part ΙΙ.\n\nBefore I sign off, a shoutout to [cnvrg.io](https://www.linkedin.com/redir/redirect?url=http%3A%2F%2Fcnvrg%2Eio&urlhash=_Wb-&trk=article-ssr-frontend-pulse_little-text-block), where I work.

Lately I've been wrestling with a fundamental architectural decision: Should my system store a curated dataset locally, or simply access the web on demand with an LLM agent? In this post I discuss: - Why ChatGPT's \"hidden\" web tool isn't available through the API, and how to recreate it in a Python script - The legal and practical guardrails of web scraping ([robots.txt](http://robots.txt?trk=public_post-text), Terms of Service) - The tradeoffs between local databases (fast, reproducible, but stale) versus live web access (fresh, flexible, but costly) - How \"context anxiety\" impacts decisions here If you've ever abandoned an AI side project to the digital basement after it spiraled into a feature creep… you'll probably relate.

Interactive Frontend: A modern, mobile-friendly interface with smooth animations and a clean dark theme for an enjoyable chat experience. Live Conversation Flow: Maintains context across multiple user messages for more natural, human-like interactions. Utility Features: Includes a “Clear Chat” function and test endpoints for quick debugging and maintenance. This project taught me: How to connect a Python backend to a third-party AI API. Managing asynchronous requests and error handling gracefully. Designing an engaging user experience with HTML/CSS. I’ve kept my API keys and sensitive configuration private, but I’d love to hear your feedback on the overall architecture and design. 💡 Tech Stack: Python, FastAPI, HTML, CSS Building this chatbot was both challenging and rewarding, and it’s just the start—I’m already thinking of new features like voice input and deployment to the cloud.

To anyone who hasn't really implemented AI in a production environment before. And when I see a I, you know, I could be talking about classical AI models or large language models. Sometimes, you know, people might think of this as one big thing. You, you train the model, you put it out there, people use it, you retrain it, you put it out there. And really there's two distinct phases and I think it's useful to decouple them in our minds. It just. Helps think about how does this all work, and then I'm going to connect this to how this works with a modern data analytics platform like Databricks that we'll use as an example. It's a tool that we tend to use quite a bit, so the model training. Really is. It's very compute heavy. It's where you use compute clusters and data bricks, use ML flow to track experiments and model versions. You use Delta Lake to manage your training datasets and use workflow jobs to automate pipelines. And because Databricks has a distributed architecture, you can you can really work with massive data sets sets, but think about this as the high compute phase. And and that's really what you're focused on is, is the GPU acceleration. And and that that's, you know, those are the tools that you would use in this phase. Once you train your model, you move to the inference phase. And what inference means basically is applying what it learned in the training phase with new data that it's interacting with in production or let's say in a production environment. And data data bricks, for example, handles this in two different ways. You can use model serving. That uses a serverless infrastructure with REST API endpoints and that allows you to automatically scale and really handle low latency responses. And then there's there's batch processing where you can use Spark or Databricks. Essentially uses Spark to generate predictions and large datasets which could be scheduled or triggered when new data arrives. Both approaches benefit from a feature store, which means that you're you're consistent with your feature computation. Between training and production. So a feature, think of it as as a part part of that model that you're training initially and the model training phase. Um, so the workflows are different, right? So the training uses heavy duty clusters with experiment tracking, while inference really optimizes for speed or for throughput. For training, you're going to configure your clusters with sufficient memory and GPUs, organize your ML code with notebooks or repositories and leverage auto scaling. And that's going to get essentially allow you to, to work with those massive datasets in the training phase. For inference, you're going to register your model and model registry. Deploy the model using model serving for real time applications so that's the low latency case. Or create batch inference jobs for high volume of predictions. Um, so again, just wanted to, to, to, to help people with that distinction between the model training phase and the inference phase, the certain implications in terms of, you know, what you're looking for and for performance, whether it's it's high compute or low latency processing.

Think of them as raw, general-purpose models straight out of training—like GPT-3 before any customization. \\*\\*\\*Foundation Models are large-scale base models\\*\\*\\* that serve as the \"foundation\" for multiple downstream applications. They're trained on vast, diverse datasets and can be adapted for various tasks—from chatbots to code generation to medical diagnosis. The key insight? All foundation models are base models, but not all base models qualify as foundation models. To be a foundation model, it needs scale, versatility, and the ability to power multiple use cases. Understanding this distinction helps us grasp how modern AI systems are built: start with a powerful foundation, then customize for your specific needs.

When to use: High-performance internal APIs and microservice-to-microservice communication in AI infra. 4. GraphQL → Shines in AI-powered dashboards or user personalization systems where the client defines the shape of data it needs. → Works great for analytics UIs that query model performance metrics, experiment runs, or user recommendations in one call. When to use: Data-rich frontends or ML observability layers. 5. Webhooks → Event-driven APIs ~ the silent backbone of MLOps automation. → Used for model lifecycle events (model deployed, retrained, failed) or CI/CD triggers in AI pipelines. → Example: A training job completes → webhook notifies deployment service → new model version goes live. When to use: Notifications, workflow chaining, and async triggers across your ML stack. 6. WebSockets → Persistent connection between client and server — perfect for real-time AI interactions. → Think LLM chat interfaces, speech-to-text streams, or live inference feedback. → Lets you stream responses token by token, instead of waiting for one big payload. When to use: Conversational AI, live dashboards, or streaming inference workloads. In AI architecture, the protocol layer is more than just a communication choice.

NESTFUL benchmark shows even top models only achieve 41% success on nested API sequences. Here's the architectural reason why. The Two Orchestration Dimensions Internal orchestration = how agents organize reasoning. External orchestration = how agents execute in the world. AsyncThink solves internal orchestration with Fork-Join primitives. An organizer spawns concurrent workers (sub-query), then synchronizes results (). Learns optimal patterns through RL with rewards for accuracy + format compliance + concurrency. Result: 28% lower latency, 89% success vs 70% sequential. But internal reasoning ≠ external execution. The core problem: probabilistic text generation vs deterministic API requirements. One syntax error breaks the chain. The Integration Architecture That Works Three layers solve this: 🔷 Knowledge graphs encode tool dependencies explicitly. Not just \"tools exist\" but \"Tool A's output type matches Tool B's input\" and \"CreateRequisition must precede CreatePurchaseOrder.\" 🔷 Declarative grammars constrain generation to valid formats. Context-free grammars (production-ready, sub-millisecond overhead) ensure syntactic correctness. LLM becomes an interpreter of formal specifications, not a free-form generator. 🔷 Runtime sandbox testing validates actual capabilities. Test components with 2-3 queries before selection, measuring real success rates vs trusting semantic similarity. This creates two-layer discovery: Semantic retrieval → candidate operations Graph traversal → dependencies + required sequences The Budget Optimization Problem Component selection is formally an online knapsack problem. You have N tools with costs c\\_i and unknown utilities v\\_i. Goal: maximize success within budget B. ZCL algorithm uses dynamic thresholds: Ψ = (U/L)^(B̂/B) where B̂ = remaining budget. Achieved 60-97% cost reduction while maintaining performance. The Knapsack composer approach tested 120 tools across GAIA, SimpleQA, and MedQA benchmarks. Self-Evolution Across Both Dimensions The breakthrough: systems that modify their own capabilities. Knowledge graphs automatically extract missing mappings from execution failures → generate RDF triples → update via SPARQL INSERT → subsequent queries leverage enriched knowledge. Ontology-based tool calling stores definitions IN the graph as queryable nodes. Domain experts add capabilities by inserting graph nodes, not writing code. System analyzes its own schema to suggest new tools. Why This Architecture Matters You're not choosing between workflows (predictable/rigid) and agents (flexible/unreliable). You're defining a behavioral envelope with formal structures while preserving adaptive capabilities within that envelope. The graph defines WHAT relationships exist. The grammar defines HOW to navigate them. The LLM interprets both in domain context.\n\n\n\n  [66](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Fposts%2Fanthony-alcaraz-b80763155_most-ai-agents-fail-at-something-embarrassingly-activity-7391081012996239360-9qwX&trk=public_post_social-actions-reactions)   [25 Comments](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Fposts%2Fanthony-alcaraz-b80763155_most-ai-agents-fail-at-something-embarrassingly-activity-7391081012996239360-9qwX&trk=public_post_social-actions-comments)\n\n  [Like](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Fposts%2Fanthony-alcaraz-b80763155_most-ai-agents-fail-at-something-embarrassingly-activity-7391081012996239360-9qwX&trk=public_post_like-cta)   [Comment](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Fposts%2Fanthony-alcaraz-b80763155_most-ai-agents-fail-at-something-embarrassingly-activity-7391081012996239360-9qwX&trk=public_post_comment-cta)\n\n  To view or add a comment, [sign in](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Fposts%2Fanthony-alcaraz-b80763155_most-ai-agents-fail-at-something-embarrassingly-activity-7391081012996239360-9qwX&trk=public_post_feed-cta-banner-cta)\n* [Victor Donet Peris](https://es.linkedin.com/in/victor-donet-peris-%E2%9C%93-01629338/en?trk=public_post_feed-actor-name)\n\n  Data Engineer | Python, SQL, ETL, Cloud & Big Data | Data Pipelines & Analytics @ MB3gestion\n\n  + [Report this post](/uas/login?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Fposts%2Fvictor-donet-peris-%25E2%259C%2593-01629338_building-real-world-ai-from-prototype-to-activity-7387377307943936000-Liov&trk=public_post_ellipsis-menu-semaphore-sign-in-redirect&guestReportContentType=POST&_f=guest-reporting)\n\n  Building Real-World AI: From Prototype to Production Artificial intelligence has become the buzzword of the decade. Every company wants to “leverage AI,” but few manage to take it beyond the prototype phase. Between proof-of-concept demos and production-grade systems lies a gap that only engineering can bridge. 1. The Prototype Trap Most AI projects start strong: a promising model, a great dataset, and a motivated team. But when it’s time to deploy, reality hits — the model doesn’t scale, the infrastructure is fragile, and the integration with existing systems is an afterthought. The real challenge isn’t training models. It’s turning models into maintainable, observable, and secure services that deliver consistent value. 2. Data Engineering Before Data Science No model can fix bad data. Clean, structured, and versioned data is the foundation of every successful AI system. Technologies like Airflow, Azure Data Factory, and Data Vault 2.0 allow teams to build reliable pipelines with proper lineage and auditing. Once the data ecosystem is healthy, model development becomes predictable instead of chaotic. 3. API-Driven AI Architecture The best AI models are invisible — users interact with them through APIs, not dashboards. Modern frameworks like FastAPI, Flask, or Django REST Framework make it simple to expose models as services, while secure authentication (using OAuth2, JWT, or IAM) ensures they can be safely integrated across microservices or third-party systems. An AI model that can’t be consumed by others is just a local experiment. 4. Automation and Observability Deploying AI in production requires a DevOps mindset. CI/CD pipelines, containerization with Docker, and continuous monitoring aren’t “nice-to-haves”; they’re survival tools. Observability — logging, metrics, and tracing — helps catch performance degradation and data drift before users notice. In production, AI doesn’t just predict — it evolves. 5. Human Context, Always Technology alone isn’t intelligence. The best systems are those that augment human decision-making rather than replace it. In sectors like education, energy, or logistics, the most successful AI projects I’ve seen were those designed around people — their workflows, limitations, and goals. --- Conclusion Building real-world AI is not about stacking models; it’s about engineering trust, scalability, and clarity. Frameworks like LangChain, OpenAI APIs, and cloud ecosystems such as Azure or AWS have made the technology accessible. But the differentiator is still craftsmanship: how well we combine algorithms, data, and infrastructure into something that simply works — day after day, at scale.\n\n  [1](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Fposts%2Fvictor-donet-peris-%25E2%259C%2593-01629338_building-real-world-ai-from-prototype-to-activity-7387377307943936000-Liov&trk=public_post_social-actions-reactions)\n\n  [Like](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Fposts%2Fvictor-donet-peris-%25E2%259C%2593-01629338_building-real-world-ai-from-prototype-to-activity-7387377307943936000-Liov&trk=public_post_like-cta)   [Comment](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Fposts%2Fvictor-donet-peris-%25E2%259C%2593-01629338_building-real-world-ai-from-prototype-to-activity-7387377307943936000-Liov&trk=public_post_comment-cta)\n\n  To view or add a comment, [sign in](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Fposts%2Fvictor-donet-peris-%25E2%259C%2593-01629338_building-real-world-ai-from-prototype-to-activity-7387377307943936000-Liov&trk=public_post_feed-cta-banner-cta)\n* [Ben Sam Oladoyin](https://ng.linkedin.com/in/ben-sam-oladoyin-527966233?trk=public_post_feed-actor-name)\n\n  Founder @ BTEHub Solutions || AI Solutions Architect || Chatbot Developer || AI Automation Agency (AAA) Builder || Trainer & Mentor || Live Audio Engineer\n\n  + [Report this post](/uas/login?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Fposts%2Fben-sam-oladoyin-527966233_jsonprompting-ai-automation-activity-7392985512929751040-v6z1&trk=public_post_ellipsis-menu-semaphore-sign-in-redirect&guestReportContentType=POST&_f=guest-reporting)\n\n  🚀 JSON Prompting Series — Episode 7 “Building JSON Prompt Chains with Conditional Logic” Welcome back, Visionaries 👋 You’ve learned how to chain multiple JSON prompts together — but what if you want your AI workflow to think, decide, and act based on context? That’s where conditional logic comes in. Conditional logic allows your AI prompts to follow “if this → then that” decisions, making your system smarter, adaptive, and automation-ready. 🔹 What Is Conditional Logic in JSON Prompting? It’s simply embedding rules and conditions inside your JSON so the next action depends on data or user input. Example 👇 { \"user\\_request\": \"Book a session\", \"conditions\": { \"if\\_intent\": \"book\\_session\", \"then\\_action\": \"collect\\_user\\_info\", \"else\\_action\": \"show\\_main\\_menu\" } } Here, if the detected intent equals \"book\\_session\", the system moves to collect user info. Otherwise, it redirects to the main menu. ⚙️ Example: Smart Chatbot Flow 🧩 Step 1 — Detect Intent { \"intent\": \"pricing\\_inquiry\", \"confidence\": 0.92 } 🧩 Step 2 — Apply Logic { \"conditions\": { \"if\\_confidence\\_above\": 0.8, \"then\\_action\": \"show\\_pricing\", \"else\\_action\": \"ask\\_for\\_clarification\" } } 🧩 Step 3 — Execute Decision { \"next\\_action\": \"show\\_pricing\", \"response\": \"Our AI Automation packages start at ₦150,000, depending on project scope.\" } The AI checks the condition (confidence > 0.8)before deciding which JSON prompt chain to trigger next. 💡 Where This Shines ✅ AI Automation Agents: Handling complex decision trees. ✅ Chatbots: Understanding user intent with fallback routes. ✅ Workflows: Switching between tasks based on conditions (e.g., data thresholds, user type, or context). 🧰 Bonus Tip: Use logic\\_blocks for Complex Decisions If your workflow has multiple conditions, group them into logic blocks 👇 { \"logic\\_blocks\": [ { \"condition\": \"user\\_type == 'new'\", \"action\": \"send\\_welcome\\_message\" }, { \"condition\": \"user\\_type == 'returning'\", \"action\": \"offer\\_loyalty\\_discount\" } ] } This structure scales beautifully for automation pipelines or chatbots that need to handle diverse user states. ✅ In Episode 8, we’ll go deeper into “Integrating JSON Prompt Chains into Real AI Systems” — connecting them with tools like LangChain, Make, Zapier, or APIs. 👉 If you could add one condition to your AI workflow today, what would it control? — BTEHub Team [#JSONPrompting](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Ffeed%2Fhashtag%2Fjsonprompting&trk=public_post-text) [#AI](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Ffeed%2Fhashtag%2Fai&trk=public_post-text) [#Automation](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Ffeed%2Fhashtag%2Fautomation&trk=public_post-text) [#BTEHub](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Ffeed%2Fhashtag%2Fbtehub&trk=public_post-text)\n\n\n\n  [2](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Fposts%2Fben-sam-oladoyin-527966233_jsonprompting-ai-automation-activity-7392985512929751040-v6z1&trk=public_post_social-actions-reactions)\n\n  [Like](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Fposts%2Fben-sam-oladoyin-527966233_jsonprompting-ai-automation-activity-7392985512929751040-v6z1&trk=public_post_like-cta)   [Comment](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Fposts%2Fben-sam-oladoyin-527966233_jsonprompting-ai-automation-activity-7392985512929751040-v6z1&trk=public_post_comment-cta)\n\n  To view or add a comment, [sign in](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Fposts%2Fben-sam-oladoyin-527966233_jsonprompting-ai-automation-activity-7392985512929751040-v6z1&trk=public_post_feed-cta-banner-cta)\n* [Bobby Meindl](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bobby-meindl-905325193?trk=public_post_feed-actor-name)\n\n  Account Executive @ Elastic\n\n  + [Report this post](/uas/login?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Fposts%2Fbobby-meindl-905325193_elastic-ai-agent-builder-for-context-engineering-activity-7386430616591835136-CO71&trk=public_post_ellipsis-menu-semaphore-sign-in-redirect&guestReportContentType=POST&_f=guest-reporting)\n\n  The hardest part of building AI agents isn't the large language model—it's providing the right context.

Core Purpose 💡 n8n is an automation platform. → It connects APIs, databases, and web apps to run workflows. → It’s about execution, not intelligence. AgentKit is a reasoning framework. → It’s about creating AI agents that can plan, decide, and act. → If n8n is a switchboard, AgentKit is a brain factory. ✅ 2. Architecture 💡 n8n runs deterministic workflows — every step is predefined. → When X happens, do Y. → Simple, predictable, linear. AgentKit is dynamic. → Each “node” can be an autonomous agent powered by an LLM. → Agents can call tools, evaluate outcomes, or even create sub-agents. →It’s not linear—it’s adaptive. ✅ 3. UI and Experience n8n’s UI is a visual workflow builder. → You drag blocks like “HTTP Request → Filter → Database Insert.” → It’s ideal for backend automation or business logic. AgentKit’s interface looks more like a control center. → You define behaviors, version prompts, add safety layers, and monitor live reasoning traces. → It’s designed for AI engineers, not operations teams. ✅ 4. Evaluation & Learning n8n executes. If something breaks, you fix it manually. → No feedback loop. AgentKit learns. → It includes built-in evaluation datasets, grading, and reinforcement fine-tuning. → Agents can improve reasoning over time. ✅ 5. Integrations n8n connects to hundreds of apps—Slack, Notion, Google Sheets, MySQL, anything REST. → It wins on breadth. AgentKit focuses on depth. → It integrates securely within OpenAI’s ecosystem—ChatGPT, OpenAI API, Teams, Enterprise setups. → Quality and governance > quantity. ✅ 6. Use Cases Use n8n if you want: → Notifications, CRMs, database syncs, ETL tasks, backend automations. Use AgentKit if you want: →Agents that classify, reason, search, respond, and adapt. Example: 💡n8n = “When a new row is added to Google Sheets, send it to Slack.” 💡AgentKit = “When a user submits a support ticket, analyze intent, search docs, and draft a context-aware response.” ✅ 7. Deployment n8n runs anywhere—your own server, Docker, or cloud. → It uses a standard [Node.js](http://Node.js?trk=public_post-text) runtime. AgentKit runs directly on OpenAI’s infrastructure. → It integrates with Guardrails, the Agents SDK, and the Workflows API. → You can embed live agents directly into your products through ChatKit. → Final Verdict 🎯If your world is automation, n8n wins. 🎯If your world is intelligence, AgentKit dominates. ✅n8n is for control. ✅AgentKit is for cognition. Both will coexist—but AgentKit signals where the future of software is heading. ♻️ If you find it useful repost it in your network.

I’m thrilled to highlight the recent announcement of Flink Agents — a new sub-project of Apache Flink designed to build intelligent, autonomous agents within a streaming data framework. Here’s why this matters: 🔍 What is Flink Agents? Flink Agents is an open-source framework (proposal FLIP-531) that brings native support to build, test, and run AI agents within Flink’s runtime. Rather than just handling batch or prompt-driven AI, this framework empowers long-running, event-triggered agents that operate on live, streaming data. 📈 Why now? Enterprise-AI Infrastructure Gap Traditional AI work often focuses on “ask a chatbot” or “run a batch model”. But many business challenges demand continuous, real-time decisioning (fraud detection, supply-chain alerts, real-time personalization). Building such agents today requires stitching together multiple tools (streaming engine + model inference + orchestration + state store). Flink Agents aims to unify this into a single runtime. The vision: every engineer becomes an “AI‐engineer” — using familiar stream APIs in Java or Python to build autonomous agents. 🧠 Key differentiators Event‐native: Agents trigger on business events, not just prompts. Stateful memory: Flink’s state backend gives agents “memory” across streams of events. Replay ability & audit: Because agents operate on streams, you can replay events, test new logic, shadow launch, audit decisions. Native integrations: Using Flink’s APIs (DataStream/Table), plus connectors, model inference, tool invocation via protocols such as Model Context Protocol (MCP). 🎯 For practitioners in data engineering & real-time analytics (that’s us!) If you’re working with streaming, event-driven architectures, LLMs or agentic AI workflows — this is a framework worth watching. For those of us building scalable, fault-tolerant data-pipelines and real-time decision systems (especially in healthcare, retail, IoT) this offers a new paradigm: embed intelligence in the stream. Given my focus on Azure/Cloud, data engineering, AI/ML, building pipelines, microservices and real‐time analytics Flink Agents intersects strongly with these trends. 🙌 Final thought As organizations move from “models” to “agents”, the infrastructure to support that shift matters more than ever. Flink Agents is a leap in that direction enabling real-time, always-on, contextual intelligence embedded in your streaming backbone. I’m looking forward to seeing how the community adopts and extends this, and keen to explore how we might apply it in our projects.

As developers, we lean on JSON—it's the universal language of APIs and databases. But when passing application data to an LLM's system prompt, the traditional JSON format is an unoptimized, token-wasting bottleneck. The shift is here: We need to adopt TOON (Token-Oriented Object Notation) to maximize efficiency in our AI workflows. The Unseen Cost of JSON in Your Prompts: Every character you send to an LLM—curly braces, double quotes, commas, and white space—consumes a token, which directly impacts latency and API costs. JSON's verbose syntax, while ideal for programmatic parsing, is an \"over-kill\" for LLMs. When we serialize a complex JSON object and pass it as a raw string inside a system prompt, we are paying for pure overhead. The Solution: Introducing TOON TOON is an emerging data format specifically engineered for passing structured data to LLMs. It borrows the best features of established formats to create a highly optimized structure: > YAML Indentation: Ensures superior human readability for debugging, logging, and observability. > CSV Tabular Format: Provides clean, uniform data rows, making the structure immediately clear to an LLM. The Impact: 30-60% Token Savings & Increased Speed The core value of TOON is tangible: token efficiency. By stripping away unnecessary JSON syntax, TOON can reduce your input token count by 30% to 60% on average. Token Usage (Example Benchmark) Traditional JSON - 15,000 Tokens Simple YAML - 13,000 Tokens TOON- 8,700 Tokens (Significant Reduction) This reduction isn't just a saving on your API bill; it translates directly to faster LLM response times because the model processes a significantly smaller input payload. 💡 Expert Insight: Mastering the Flattening Rule While TOON is a powerful solution, it requires an important optimization step for developers to avoid a hidden performance trap: TOON performs optimally only with flat data structures. If you attempt to encode highly nested JSON directly into TOON, you can actually end up using more tokens than the original JSON. The Best Practice for High-Efficiency AI Pipelines: > Flatten your JSON: Before sending data to the LLM, programmatically flatten your nested JSON objects (e.g., converting a nested address object into flat fields like address\\_street, address\\_city). > Encode to TOON: Convert the now-flat data structure into TOON format. Send to LLM: Pass the highly optimized TOON payload to the system prompt. By mastering this flattening technique, we can ensure that we are always sending the most compact, human-readable, and cost-efficient data to our LLMs, marking a key evolution in the AI application development lifecycle.\n\n  [5](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Fposts%2Fashjoresume_100daysoflearninggenai-activity-7392649249748000768-_XTY&trk=public_post_social-actions-reactions)   [3 Comments](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Fposts%2Fashjoresume_100daysoflearninggenai-activity-7392649249748000768-_XTY&trk=public_post_social-actions-comments)\n\n  [Like](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Fposts%2Fashjoresume_100daysoflearninggenai-activity-7392649249748000768-_XTY&trk=public_post_like-cta)   [Comment](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Fposts%2Fashjoresume_100daysoflearninggenai-activity-7392649249748000768-_XTY&trk=public_post_comment-cta)\n\n  To view or add a comment, [sign in](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Fposts%2Fashjoresume_100daysoflearninggenai-activity-7392649249748000768-_XTY&trk=public_post_feed-cta-banner-cta)\n* [arun sundar sundararajan](https://in.linkedin.com/in/arun-sundar-sundararajan-2b30b917a?trk=public_post_feed-actor-name)\n\n  Gen AI Enthusiast | Data Engineer | Fabric Certified | Databricks Certified | AWS Certified | PySpark | Ex-CGI | Ex-Cognizant | BE CSE @ GCT Coimbatore\n\n  + [Report this post](/uas/login?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Fposts%2Farun-sundar-sundararajan-2b30b917a_databricks-langchain-llm-activity-7385583079492354048--SIt&trk=public_post_ellipsis-menu-semaphore-sign-in-redirect&guestReportContentType=POST&_f=guest-reporting)\n\n  𝗺𝘂𝗹𝘁𝗶-𝘀𝘁𝗮𝗴𝗲 𝗿𝗲𝗮𝘀𝗼𝗻𝗶𝗻𝗴 Gen AI 𝗔𝗽𝗽𝘀 using LangChain in Databricks Gen AI Apps not only retrieve & synthesize info, but can also 𝗥𝗘𝗔𝗦𝗢𝗡 it building & managing multi-stage Apps require -

Our models are trained using spaCy, scikit-learn, Transformers + ONNX. In the end, we decided to go with a FastAPI + Celery (RabbitMQ) solution since we currently manage only four models. However, as our number of models grows, we plan to migrate to KServe for better scalability and management. I’ve also shared a short gist summarizing some key points on how to use KServe to deploy models 👇 🔗 [https://lnkd.in/dVd7X3Bs](https://www.linkedin.com/redir/redirect?url=https%3A%2F%2Flnkd%2Ein%2FdVd7X3Bs&urlhash=ewpl&trk=public_post-text) [#KServe](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Ffeed%2Fhashtag%2Fkserve&trk=public_post-text) [#FastAPI](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Ffeed%2Fhashtag%2Ffastapi&trk=public_post-text) [#Celery](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Ffeed%2Fhashtag%2Fcelery&trk=public_post-text) [#RabbitMQ](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Ffeed%2Fhashtag%2Frabbitmq&trk=public_post-text) [#Python](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Ffeed%2Fhashtag%2Fpython&trk=public_post-text) [#OracleACEProgram](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Ffeed%2Fhashtag%2Foracleaceprogram&trk=public_post-text) [#OracleACE](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Ffeed%2Fhashtag%2Foracleace&trk=public_post-text)\n\n[KServe Models Format   gist.github.com](https://www.linkedin.com/redir/redirect?url=https%3A%2F%2Fgist%2Egithub%2Ecom%2Fjohnidm%2F27d9a642e3c67c8721459c0ab5197437&urlhash=Q4PN&trk=public_post_feed-article-content)\n\n[7](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww%2Elinkedin%2Ecom%2Fposts%2Fjohnidouglas_kserve-models-format-activity-7386028135768539136-ARti&trk=public_post_social-actions-reactions)\n\n[Like](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww%2Elinkedin%2Ecom%2Fposts%2Fjohnidouglas_kserve-models-format-activity-7386028135768539136-ARti&trk=public_post_like-cta)   [Comment](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww%2Elinkedin%2Ecom%2Fposts%2Fjohnidouglas_kserve-models-format-activity-7386028135768539136-ARti&trk=public_post_comment-cta)\n\nTo view or add a comment, [sign in](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww%2Elinkedin%2Ecom%2Fposts%2Fjohnidouglas_kserve-models-format-activity-7386028135768539136-ARti&trk=public_post_feed-cta-banner-cta)\n\n## More Relevant Posts\n\n* [Atharva Chavhan](https://in.linkedin.com/in/atharva-chavhan-b5742b259?trk=public_post_feed-actor-name)\n\n  Startup Enthusiast | Python developer | AIML | Flask | MySQL | MongoDB\n\n  + [Report this post](/uas/login?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Fposts%2Fatharva-chavhan-b5742b259_deeplearning-ai-machinelearning-activity-7386627803791888384-5CJS&trk=public_post_ellipsis-menu-semaphore-sign-in-redirect&guestReportContentType=POST&_f=guest-reporting)\n\n  Excited to share my latest Deep Learning project! Project: CIFAR-10 ResNet18 Image Recognition Tech Stack: Python | Flask | PyTorch | TorchVision | HTML | CSS | JS I built a real-time image classification system using a pre-trained ResNet18 model that can recognize images from the CIFAR-10 dataset directly in your browser! Key Highlights: 🔹 Real-time prediction using ResNet18 🔹 Upload & preview images instantly in the browser 🔹 Displays 10 detailed insights about each predicted class 🔹 Beautiful gradient-based responsive UI 🔹 Modular & extensible architecture 🔹 Built with Flask (backend) and HTML/CSS/JS (frontend) Future Enhancements: Add support for all CIFAR-10 classes Deploy on AWS / Heroku Add drag-and-drop uploads & confidence scores This project helped me deepen my understanding of deep learning, computer vision, and model deployment using Flask.

FastEmbed? It uses ONNX Runtime instead. 𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗿𝗲𝘀𝘂𝗹𝘁 👉🏽 Lighter than your average Python library 👉🏽 No GPU needed (but supports it if you want) 👉🏽 Faster than PyTorch for inference 👉🏽 Perfect for serverless (hello AWS Lambda) 👉🏽 Has a Rust version 𝗪𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝗺𝗮𝗸𝗲𝘀 𝗶𝘁 𝗰𝗼𝗼𝗹 FastEmbed supports: - Sense embeddings - Sparse embeddings (SPLADE++) - Late interaction models (ColBERT) - Image embeddings, - Even rerankers. All with the same clean API. The default model (Flag Embedding) sits at the top of the MTEB leaderboard and supports \"query\" and \"passage\" prefixes out of the box. Getting started takes 3 lines. The library handles model downloads automatically, uses data parallelism for large datasets, and keeps memory usage minimal. 𝗕𝗲𝘆𝗼𝗻𝗱 𝘁𝗲𝘅𝘁 Need image embeddings? ColBERT for retrieval? Reranking? FastEmbed has you covered. You can even extend it with custom models not in their supported list. If you're building RAG apps or vector search, this library deserves a look. It's maintained by Qdrant and gets regular updates. Have you tried FastEmbed yet?

Model Context Protocol lets you give AI custom superpowers by writing simple Python functions. Server has 3 tools:  - Web search (Tavily API)  - Dice roller (because why not)  - Instagram post fetcher (RapidAPI) The wild part?

If you’ve ever tried using LLMs for information extraction, such as pulling market sentiment from earnings calls, parsing clinical notes for symptoms, or scanning materials science papers for new compounds, you’ve probably hit the same frustrations I have. Building reliable extraction pipelines with LLMs turns out to be way harder than it looks. Ad hoc scripts break when APIs fail, waste tokens on redundant calls, produce inconsistent results, and make it nearly impossible to compare different approaches systematically. Together with [Kirill Skobelev](https://www.linkedin.com/in/skobelevkirill?trk=public_post-text) at the [Center for Applied Artificial Intelligence at Chicago Booth](https://www.linkedin.com/showcase/center-for-applied-artificial-intelligence-at-chicago-booth-/?trk=public_post-text) , we built DELM to fix that. It takes care of caching, custom extraction schemas, cost tracking, and flexible splitting and scoring strategies, so you can focus on more interesting stuff.

You might have a \"Silent Model Killer\".  The problem? Data Leakage.  It's a subtle but dangerous mistake often made during preprocessing. If you use StandardScaler before train\\_test\\_split, you are \"cheating\" by leaking test set information into your training process.  I’ve attached a quick guide showing the wrong way, the right way, and the professional fix using Pipeline.  Stop leaks, build trustworthy models.

One random thought turned into, “What if I build something that could actually help in back-office operations?” So instead of watching a series, I ended up creating a mini AI powerhouse. This tool can extract thousands of data points directly from documents into Excel simply by providing a prompt. You define the fields, and it auto-generates columns and fills the data — all powered by Python, LangChain, Azure Form Recogniser, GPT-4.1, and Streamlit for the UI. Four hours later, I had a working prototype… and honestly, that was way more satisfying than finishing a Netflix series. 😄 [#AI](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Ffeed%2Fhashtag%2Fai&trk=public_post-text) [#Automation](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Ffeed%2Fhashtag%2Fautomation&trk=public_post-text) [#Python](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Ffeed%2Fhashtag%2Fpython&trk=public_post-text) [#LangChain](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Ffeed%2Fhashtag%2Flangchain&trk=public_post-text) [#Azure](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Ffeed%2Fhashtag%2Fazure&trk=public_post-text) [#GPT4](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Ffeed%2Fhashtag%2Fgpt4&trk=public_post-text) .1#Streamlit [#Innovation](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Ffeed%2Fhashtag%2Finnovation&trk=public_post-text) [#DataAutomation](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Ffeed%2Fhashtag%2Fdataautomation&trk=public_post-text) [#kbs](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Ffeed%2Fhashtag%2Fkbs&trk=public_post-text) [#kone](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Ffeed%2Fhashtag%2Fkone&trk=public_post-text) [#genai](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Ffeed%2Fhashtag%2Fgenai&trk=public_post-text)\n\n  [32](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Fposts%2Fjayanthan-muralidharan-8449771a0_ai-automation-python-activity-7388007488853483520-Cth8&trk=public_post_social-actions-reactions)   [2 Comments](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Fposts%2Fjayanthan-muralidharan-8449771a0_ai-automation-python-activity-7388007488853483520-Cth8&trk=public_post_social-actions-comments)\n\n  [Like](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Fposts%2Fjayanthan-muralidharan-8449771a0_ai-automation-python-activity-7388007488853483520-Cth8&trk=public_post_like-cta)   [Comment](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Fposts%2Fjayanthan-muralidharan-8449771a0_ai-automation-python-activity-7388007488853483520-Cth8&trk=public_post_comment-cta)\n\n  To view or add a comment, [sign in](https://www.linkedin.com/signup/cold-join?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Fposts%2Fjayanthan-muralidharan-8449771a0_ai-automation-python-activity-7388007488853483520-Cth8&trk=public_post_feed-cta-banner-cta)\n* [Mohammed Al Hashim](https://sa.linkedin.com/in/mohammed-al-hashim-9b12641a5?trk=public_post_feed-actor-name)\n\n  💡AI & Data Science | Computer Vision | NLP | Azure Certified | Data Scientist at Artificial intelligence global company\n\n  + [Report this post](/uas/login?session_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Fposts%2Fmohammed-al-hashim-9b12641a5_ai-llm-langchain-activity-7386319729625473024-nTQo&trk=public_post_ellipsis-menu-semaphore-sign-in-redirect&guestReportContentType=POST&_f=guest-reporting)\n\n  How to Get Structured Output from an LLM Many people think LLMs only return plain text, but they can also give structured results like JSON, tables, or lists — if you ask them correctly. Here’s how 👇 1. Be clear about the format Tell the model exactly what you need. Example: “Return your answer in JSON with keys: name, age, and skills.” 2. Use clear boundaries Add something like: “Only output valid JSON between triple backticks.” This helps the model keep the output clean and easy to parse. 3. Check the output Always validate it using a parser (for example, [json.loads](http://json.loads?trk=public_post-text)() in Python). If it fails, add a simple retry or fallback. 4. Show examples Give the model one or two examples of what you expect. It helps the model understand your format better. 5. Use structured frameworks Tool like LangChain’s StructuredOutputParser can make sure the model always follows your schema.

You will not be missed. 🍷🐍 Python 3.14 is removing the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL)… after 30 years of acting like that one coworker who must hold the whiteboard marker at all times. For decades, Python could technically run on multiple cores, but the GIL said: “No. Only one thread at a time. Everyone else sit down.” But now… • Real multi-core parallelism • Threads that actually thread • Async that doesn’t break down crying • AI pipelines that don’t require spiritual forgiveness and message queues For Data & ML folks, this means: • Faster data processing • More scalable inference + agents • CPU-heavy workflows without “fine, I’ll rewrite it in Rust” energy This is not just a performance upgrade. This is Python getting on steroid 🏋️ (Note: Python 3.14 ships with both the standard build and the new free-threaded build — so adoption will roll in gradually.)

The API allows enterprises to deploy AI models and applications into production for end users without worrying about procuring or maintaining compute.\n\nThe launch complements Lambda's existing focus on providing GPU clusters for training and fine-tuning machine learning models.\n\n“Our platform is fully verticalized, meaning we can pass dramatic cost savings to end users compared to other providers like OpenAI,\" said Robert Brooks, Lambda’s vice president of revenue, in a video call interview with VentureBeat. \"Plus, there are no rate limits inhibiting scaling, and you don’t have to talk to a salesperson to get started.\"\n\nIn fact, as Brooks told VentureBeat, developers can head over to [Lambda's new Inference API](https://lambdalabs.com/inference) webpage, generate an API key, and get started in less than five minutes.\n\nLambda’s Inference API supports leading-edge models such as [Meta's Llama 3.3](https://venturebeat.com/ai/meta-launches-open-source-llama-3-3-shrinking-powerful-bigger-model-into-smaller-size/) and 3.1, [Nous's Hermes-3](https://venturebeat.com/ai/meet-hermes-3-the-powerful-new-open-source-ai-model-that-has-existential-crises/), and [Alibaba's Qwen 2.5](https://github.com/QwenLM/Qwen2.5), making it one of the most accessible options for the machine learning community. The [full list](https://docs.lambdalabs.com/public-cloud/lambda-inference-api/) is available here and includes:\n\n* deepseek-coder-v2-lite-instruct\n* dracarys2-72b-instruct\n* hermes3-405b\n* hermes3-405b-fp8-128k\n* hermes3-70b\n* hermes3-8b\n* lfm-40b\n* llama3.1-405b-instruct-fp8\n* llama3.1-70b-instruct-fp8\n* llama3.1-8b-instruct\n* llama3.2-3b-instruct\n* llama3.1-nemotron-70b-instruct\n* llama3.3-70b\n\nPricing begins at $0.02 per million tokens for smaller models like Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct, and scales up to $0.90 per million tokens for larger, state-of-the-art models such as Llama 3.1-405B-Instruct.\n\nAs Lambda cofounder and CEO Stephen Balaban put it recently on X, \"Stop wasting money and start using Lambda for LLM Inference.\" Balaban published a graph showing its per-token cost for serving up AI models through inference compared to rivals in the space.\n\nFurthermore, unlike many other services, Lambda’s pay-as-you-go model ensures customers pay only for the tokens they use, eliminating the need for subscriptions or rate-limited plans.\n\n## Closing the AI loop\n\nLambda has a decade-plus history of supporting AI advancements with its GPU-based infrastructure.\n\nFrom its hardware solutions to its training and fine-tuning capabilities, the company has built a reputation as a reliable partner for enterprises, research institutions, and startups.\n\n“Understand that Lambda has been deploying GPUs for well over a decade to our user base, and so we're sitting on literally tens of thousands of Nvidia GPUs, and some of them can be from older life cycles and newer life cycles, allowing us to still get maximum utility out of those AI chips for the wider ML community, at reduced costs as well,\" Brooks explained. \"With the launch of Lambda Inference, we’re closing the loop on the full-stack AI development lifecycle. The new API formalizes what many engineers had already been doing on Lambda’s platform — using it for inference — but now with a dedicated service that simplifies deployment.\"\n\nBrooks noted that its deep reservoir of GPU resources is one of Lambda’s distinguishing features, reiterating that “Lambda has deployed tens of thousands of GPUs over the past decade, allowing us to offer cost-effective solutions and maximum utility for both older and newer AI chips.”\n\nThis GPU advantage enables the platform to support scaling to trillions of tokens monthly, providing flexibility for developers and enterprises alike.\n\n## Open and flexible\n\nLambda is positioning itself as a flexible alternative to cloud giants by offering unrestricted access to high-performance inference.\n\n“We want to give the machine learning community unrestricted access to inference APIs. You can plug and play, read the docs, and scale rapidly to trillions of tokens,” Brooks explained.\n\nThe API supports a range of open-source and proprietary models, including popular instruction-tuned Llama models.\n\nThe company has also hinted at expanding to multimodal applications, including video and image generation, in the near future.\n\n“Initially, we’re focused on text-based LLMs, but soon we’ll expand to multimodal models,” Brooks said.\n\n## Serving devs and enterprises with privacy and security\n\nThe Lambda Inference API targets a wide range of users, from startups to large enterprises, in media, entertainment, and software development.\n\nThese industries are increasingly adopting AI to power applications like text summarization, code generation, and generative content creation.\n\n“There’s no retention or sharing of user data on our platform. We act as a conduit for serving data to end users, ensuring privacy,” Brooks emphasized, reinforcing Lambda’s commitment to security and user control.\n\nAs AI adoption continues to rise, Lambda’s new service is poised to attract attention from businesses seeking cost-effective solutions for deploying and maintaining AI models. By eliminating common barriers such as rate limits and high operating costs, Lambda hopes to empower more organizations to harness AI's potential.\n\nThe Lambda Inference API is available now, with detailed pricing and documentation accessible through [Lambda’s](https://lambdalabs.com/inference) [website.](https://lambdalabs.com/inference)\n\n## More"
